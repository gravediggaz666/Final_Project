o Insights and Results – 

During the development process, I encountered several challenges and learned valuable lessons. Here are some insights and results from my experience:

Handling Server-Side Errors: I faced issues with server-side errors, such as 500 Internal Server Error, which required careful debugging. Through this process, I learned how to effectively troubleshoot server-side code and identify potential issues, such as misconfigured endpoints or incorrect data processing.
Client-Server Communication: Working with client-server communication using RESTful APIs was a significant part of the project. I gained a deeper understanding of how data flows between the client and server and the importance of properly handling HTTP requests and responses.
Authentication and Authorization: Implementing authentication and authorization features posed some challenges, especially ensuring secure access to certain endpoints. I learned about various authentication methods and best practices for securing web applications.
